    <h3>Description:</h3>
        <p>Soy sauce, onions, salt, pepper, calamansi– these are a couple of ingredients you may commonly find in most classic Filipino viands. And the appeal definitely resonates well with us as these truly go well with a great deal of dishes, blending perfectly with savory flavors. It makes sense then for these much-favored seasonings and spices to come together in one recipe. Filipino beef steak, more fondly known as Bistek, utilizes this beautiful combination. But today, we’ll be exploring Pork Steak, which is a twist on that original recipe in using succulent pork chops as its meat.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 pieces pork chops</li>

            <li>2 pieces onions sliced</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups water</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon granulated white sugar</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ul>

            <li>Add-in the sugar, salt, and pepper then stir.</li>
            <li>Put-in the onions and cook for 3 minutes more.</li>
